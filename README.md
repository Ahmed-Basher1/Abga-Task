# Online Task Management System

## Overview

This project is an **Online Task Management System** built using NestJS. It covers various aspects of backend development, including user authentication, task management, email notifications, logging, error handling, testing, and deployment. The project demonstrates comprehensive skills in backend development with NestJS, ensuring security, scalability, and maintainability.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Includes roles such as admin and regular users.
- **Authorization Middleware**: Restricts access to certain routes based on user roles.

### 2. Task Management

- **CRUD Operations**: Allows creation, reading, updating, and deletion of tasks.
- **Task Assignment**: Tasks can be assigned to specific users.
- **Task Status**: Tasks can be marked as completed, and filtered based on their status (completed, pending).
- **Pagination**: Implements pagination for task listings to improve performance.

### 3. User Profile

- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information such as name and email.
- **User-Specific Tasks**: Users can view tasks assigned specifically to them.

### 4. Email Notifications

- **Task Notifications**: Sends email notifications when tasks are assigned or completed using a third-party service like SendGrid.

### 5. Logging and Error Handling

- **Winston Logging**: Implements logging using Winston, with logs being saved to files and displayed in the console.
- **Centralized Error Handling**: All errors are handled centrally using custom error handling middleware.

### 6. Unit and Integration Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Written for services, controllers, and other modules using Jest.
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints are tested using Supertest to ensure correct integration.

### 7. Database Integration

- **PostgreSQL/MongoDB**: Supports PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Database Migrations**: Implements migrations for schema changes to ensure smooth updates.

### 8. Swagger Documentation

- **API Documentation**: Generates API documentation using the NestJS Swagger module for easy reference and testing.

### 9. Deployment

- **Cloud Deployment**: The application can be deployed to cloud platforms such as Heroku or AWS.

### 10. Security

- **Best Practices**: Implements security best practices including input validation, sanitization, and securing sensitive data.
